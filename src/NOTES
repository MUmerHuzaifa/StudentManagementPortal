/* 
1) How to create a Component 
First i created component with name in app under src 
Then i created name.component.ts file
 { in this ts file, I created class, then add decorator 
    { in decorator i added three things 
        ( selector for html tag, html file path , and css file path )
    }
    then or before i imported compoenent from './@angular/core'
}
i created html file to give path to decorator with name - name.component.html
i added html tag to app.component.html file in div tag
i added my class of NameComponent to app.module.ts file under @NgModule section [this will tell angular that this is a component]
